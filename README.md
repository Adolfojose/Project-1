# Project-1

The files that should be considered in this repository are as follows: Final_EDA_HD.ipynb, Honorable_Mentions.ipynb, Heart_Disease_Prediction.csv, and heart.csv. All of the other files on this repository are just check points/ideas we had along the way.

Final_EDA_HD.ipynb, Heart_Disease_Prediction.csv, and heart.csv are where you will be able to find all of the data that we though was necessary to answer our question for this project. 
Honorable_Mentions.ipynb is a file that shows some of the figures that we made and tests that we ran that we determined were not necessary to properly analyze our questoin. 

Althernative hypothesis: The factors that are attributed to heart disease will increase between the ages of 45-65.
Null hypothesis: The factors that are attributed to heart disease will not increase between the ages of 45-65.

Note: We are looking at factors that are commonly attributed to heart disease in regaurds to age, not these factors against heart disease itself.
